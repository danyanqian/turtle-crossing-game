# turtle-crossing-game

This Turtle Crossing Game is part of the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. (Day 23) 

Similar to crossing road game, we have a whole bunch of cars, going across a super busy multilane highway, and our turtle is the player who have to cross the road.

Use the arrow up key to move the turtle to the other side of the street without getting hit by a car. Be careful as the cars will be moving faster, each time you level up.
